# Stylus-Based Enclave Compute Provider

This repository contains the implementation of a Stylus-based Compute Provider for encrypted execution environments, designed to securely process votes using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) directly on-chain. This compute provider leverages Arbitrum Stylus to perform on-chain computations efficiently while ensuring data privacy and integrity.
